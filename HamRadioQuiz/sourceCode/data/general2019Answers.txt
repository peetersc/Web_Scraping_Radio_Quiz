There is no interaction between transmission line loss and SWR
If a transmission line is lossy, high SWR will increase the loss
High SWR makes it difficult to measure transmission line loss
High SWR reduces the relative effect of transmission line loss

The higher the transmission line loss, the more the SWR will read artificially high
The higher the transmission line loss, the more accurate the SWR measurement will be

There is no interaction between transmission line loss and SWR
If a transmission line is lossy, high SWR will increase the loss
High SWR makes it difficult to measure transmission line loss
High SWR reduces the relative effect of transmission line loss
The higher the transmission line loss, the more the SWR will read artificially low
The higher the transmission line loss, the more the SWR will read artificially high
The higher the transmission line loss, the more accurate the SWR measurement will be
Transmission line loss does not affect the SWR measurement
